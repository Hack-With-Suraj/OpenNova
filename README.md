# Summary

OpenNova is an open-source curriculum designed to document and share the self-taught journey of mastering Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics at a level equivalent to a **full bachelor's degree** in these fields. This curriculum is inspired by the structure and rigor of [OSSU (Open Source Society University)](https://github.com/ossu) in [CS](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) and [Mathematics](https://github.com/ossu/math), with an additional focus on Physics to create a holistic foundation for advanced studies and research.

## What is OpenNova?
OpenNova is a living Project (repository) of NovaVerseOrg that evolves with its creator's learning journey. As each course, topic, or resource is completed, it is added to the repository, along with detailed notes, insights, and recommendations. The goal is to:

1. **Guide learners** : Provide a roadmap for others seeking a similar path.
2. **Curate resources** : Share only the most valuable and effective resources for learning.
3. **Build expertise** : Equip learners with skills equivalent to a bachelor’s degree in the three disciplines.

## Why OpenNova?
1. **Multidisciplinary Focus** : Combines CS, Mathematics, and Physics into a unified curriculum, preparing learners for quantum computing, AI, and scientific research.
2. **Real-World Relevance** : The curriculum emphasizes practical and theoretical knowledge, blending applied skills with rigorous academic foundations.
3. **Open and Adaptive** : Unlike static curriculums, OpenNova grows organically as its creator progresses, ensuring that it always reflects up-to-date and firsthand experiences.

## Key Features of OpenNova
1. **Dynamic Learning** : Resources are added only after they have been tested and completed by the creator, ensuring high-quality recommendations.
2. **Comprehensive Coverage** : Aims to match the depth and breadth of a bachelor's degree in CS, Mathematics, and Physics.
3. **Resource Recommendations** : Links to free, open-source, and paid resources (if essential) that helped shape the creator's understanding.

## How to Use OpenNova
1. **Follow the Curriculum** : Start with the basics and work through intermediate and advanced topics.
2. **Leverage the Resources** : Use the curated materials and notes to enhance your learning.
3. **Tackle Projects** : Apply your knowledge in real-world scenarios to solidify your understanding.

## Who is OpenNova For?
- **Self-Taught Learners** : Anyone seeking a structured and comprehensive path to mastering CS, Mathematics, and Physics.
- **Aspiring Researchers**: Those aiming to specialize in areas like quantum computing, AI, or advanced physics.
- **Professionals** : Individuals looking to deepen their knowledge or pivot into technical fields.

## Conclusion
OpenNova is not just a curriculum; it’s a testament to the power of self-learning and the open-source spirit. By following this roadmap, learners can gain an equivalent level of expertise to a **full bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics, while also engaging with cutting-edge fields like quantum computing.** As the journey unfolds, OpenNova will continue to evolve, empowering others to achieve their educational goals.

**Cost**. All or nearly all course material is available for free. However, some courses may charge money for assignments/tests/projects to be graded.
Note that both [Coursera](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/209819033-Apply-for-Financial-Aid-or-a-Scholarship?language=en_US) and [edX](https://courses.edx.org/financial-assistance/) offer financial aid.

# Prerequisites
## OpenNova Prerequisites

OpenNova is more than a platform for learning Computer Science (CS), Mathematics, or Physics it's a journey for those with the ambition to revolutionize these fields. As the owner of OpenNova, my goal is to become a **computer scientist and mathematician specializing in quantum computing**, and I invite like-minded individuals to join this mission.

This platform is specifically designed for learners who aspire to:

1. **Become a computer scientist**
2. **Become a computer scientist and mathematician**
3. **Specialize in a field of CS, Mathematics, or Physics and contribute groundbreaking research or innovations**
4. **Excel as a mathematician or physicist, creating a lasting impact**
5. **Add revolutionary contributions in CS, Physics, or Mathematics**

<br>

> **Note** :- 
> 1.  If your goal is job preparation or gaining a general understanding of these fields, resources like [OSSU CS](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) and [OSSU Math](https://github.com/ossu/math) are excellent choices. OpenNova, however, is for learners who aim to leave a mark and contribute meaningfully to these disciplines.
> 2. Starting in 2 years Open Nova is focusing on providing Best Structured and best resources curriculum for gaining full bachelor's degree level Skills in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics, while also engaging with cutting-edge fields like quantum computing.

## Mathematics Prerequisites
Mathematics is the backbone of all three fields. Having a strong foundation in mathematics will be invaluable, regardless of the specialization.

For a solid foundation, start with the following courses on **Khan Academy** :

> **Note** :- We assume That students have 0 Knowledge In mathematics because Future Topics Require a Strong foundation in Algebra and Geometry and This Algebra and Geometry By Khan Academy Will Provide You with Proper Knowledge From Scratch Start With Zero You Can Skip Luctures And give a Test or solve Prictic Questions and if you stuck in any topic then revise that topic and Mester it 

1. [**Algebra**](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home)
2. [**Geometry**](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry-home)

Crucial for spatial reasoning, which is fundamental in Physics and CS (e.g., graphics, simulations).

1. [**Trigonometry**](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/trigonometry)
2. [**Precalculus**](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus)

it Prepares you for calculus, the foundation of advanced mathematics and physics.

These courses will establish a robust mathematical foundation necessary for deeper exploration into advanced topics in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics.
